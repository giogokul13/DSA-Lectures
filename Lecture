Time and Space Complexity (TASC)

"Time and Space Complexity is the function which gives us the relationship about how your time will grow as the input grows"


Why Do we Need TASC?

1. Identify and optimize the process times in the operation




Which is Best?

O(1) <-- O(log n) <-- O(n) <--- O(2^N)


Points to consider while thinking on Complexities.

1. Always consider the worst-case complexities
2 Always Look the complexity of Large/Infinte Data
3. Renove the constants in calculating the complexities
4. Always ignore less dominating terms in calculation on complexities.

N^3 + N^2 + N + 6 = N^3 // as removing constants (6) and removing less dominant N^2 and N
